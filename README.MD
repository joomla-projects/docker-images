# Docker Container with PHP 5.4

# ATTENTION! We strongly suggest to NOT use this Docker image!
It is horribly outdated and we are keeping it only to ensure out compatibility claims. PHP 5.4 has been EOL since September 2015.

Docker Container for unit testing with PHP 5.4 and our PHP Unit extensions.
